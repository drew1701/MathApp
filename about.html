  <p>Kids Are Us requires a new website to engage kids with learning math online. The site
    should develop the four basic math operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
    division. The students and teachers should be able to track progress and achievements for
    development.
    This website will be responsive and teach basic math while making learning fun. Practice
    problems will be timed and pop quizzes will be provided, kids will be able to view scores and
    track achievements.
    WeCodeEdu is uniquely qualified to build the website that you desire, due to our in-house team
    of designers, writers, and developers, and our experience working with clients in Education .</p>
